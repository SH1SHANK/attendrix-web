# Lumen AI

Lumen is Attendrix's intelligent AI assistant that lives inside Telegram. Think of it as your personal attendance advisor — always available, always accurate.

## What Can Lumen Do?

### Safe Cut Calculations

Lumen calculates exactly how many classes you can skip for each subject while staying above the 75% threshold.

```
You: How many classes can I skip in DSA?

Lumen: 📊 DSA Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Attended: 32/40 (80%)
Safe to skip: 2 more classes
Next class: Tomorrow, 9:00 AM
```

### Attendance Predictions

Based on your historical patterns, Lumen predicts your month-end attendance:

- **Green Zone** — You're on track for 80%+
- **Yellow Zone** — Careful! You're at 75-80%
- **Red Zone** — Critical! Below 75%

### Smart Notifications

Lumen proactively alerts you when:

1. You're about to hit the danger zone for a subject
2. A class is cancelled (based on pattern detection)
3. Your weekly streak is at risk

## How It Works

Lumen uses a combination of:

1. **Real-time Data** — Your current attendance from the Supabase ledger
2. **Pattern Analysis** — Historical attendance patterns for predictions
3. **Gemini AI** — Natural language understanding for conversational queries
