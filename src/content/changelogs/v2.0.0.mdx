# The Gamification Engine (v2.0.0)

This update introduces **Amplix**, our advanced gamification engine designed to transform the attendance experience into a rewarding journey. We've laid the groundwork for questing, progression, and automated challenges.

### 🚀 Features

- **Amplix Gamification System**: A complete overhaul of user engagement logic.
- **Mage Level System**: Users can now progress from **Level 1 (Novice)** to **Level 12 (Master Mage)** based on earned XP.

### ⚙️ Backend

- **Supabase RPC Integration**: Added `generate_challenges` and `evaluate_challenges` functions for automated, server-side quest management.
- **Firebase Sync**: Implemented `challengeKey` logic to handle Weekly and Monthly rotation directly in Firestore User documents.

### 🗄️ Database

- **Schema Expansion**: Created new PostgreSQL tables for tracking progress:
  - `amplixChallenges`: Definition of available quests.
  - `amplixChallengeProgress`: Real-time tracking of user achievements.
  - `amplixLogs`: Archival history of completed challenges.
