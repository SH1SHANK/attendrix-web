# Visual Overhaul & Experience (v2.0.5)

We've completely reimagined how you interact with Attendrix. Moving away from standard layouts, we embraced a **Neo-Brutalist** aesthetic that emphasizes clarity, bold identity, and rapid information scanning.

### 💅 UI/UX

- **Neo-Brutalist Refactor**: High-contrast borders, dot-grid backgrounds, and a refined typography stack featuring **Inter** and **JetBrains Mono**.
- **Challenges Dashboard**: Rebuilt the interface to categorize quests into **Claimable** (with a signature Gold Glow), **In Progress**, and **Completed** states.
- **Ticket Stub Layout**: The Home Screen now features a compact "Ticket Stub" design for upcoming classes and a vertical timeline for your daily schedule.

### 📊 Visualization

- **Player Card**: A new profile component featuring liquid progress bars and intelligent calculators for your next rank achievement.

### 🧩 Components

- Refactored core navigation elements to match the new high-contrast design system.
